## Projects

Below is a showcase of personal projects I have worked on since starting my computer science degree at Boise State.

### Chess Coordinate Trainer

To practice my programming and learn the coordinates on a chess board I built a chess coordinate trainer. I took a public prebuilt chessboard and then started with html and javascript locally to develop the application. I then used Ionic to make it a mobile app using the angular framework.
